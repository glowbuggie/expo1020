## Expo components

![Expo Program Guide Cover](/4.%20Information%20and%20Signs%20for%20Venue/en_US/2.%20Program%20Guide/program_guide_inside.jpg)

Our expo consists the following. Each will have its own folder for source materials and information. Feel free to use any part of it for your event, as we know the event space and format might be different!
[Our goal of the 1020 expo](#original-intention-of-the-expo) is to gather signatures, letters and postcards for US senators, in order to help push the HKHRDAct. We invite you to have a similar goal for your local event for a greater impact!

## Original Intention of the Expo

1. To bring awareness to the general public in USA of the civil unrest in Hong Kong that have already lasted for months. 
2. We want to educate the public from different perspectives to spark conversations and critical, independent thinking. Especially this movement is not only affecting Hong Kong, the HK govt and CCP are actually threatening the whole world 
3. To create and unite a community to keep engaging the situation in Hong Kong, and to provide supports to our Hong Kong 手足 when necessary 
4. The expo will be presented multiple times around Bay Area for similar purposes. It will be best if materials can be reused. And also will be updated for future expos as situations are changing dramatically 
5. The most important part is the booth hosts, to be able to deliver the message loud and clear. The materials are important but it is more powerful to directly have conversations with our visitors. To build relationship and be genuine. 

## Languages Covered

Currently only US English. Please help expand this!

## Expo Expenses

There are costs to hosting an expo of this size. However, if you want to make any exhibition of any size, and take from our materials, go for it..!!

The cost breakdown (so teams have an idea) will be coming soon.

## Description of Each Area

### Information booths
- [Folder](/1.%20Information%20Booths)
- Most of our booths are printed on 11x17 cardstock and arranged onto 20x30 foam boards, to be stuck on wall or propped up.
- Some PDF files will have black guides to help cut and align the pages.

### Timeline
- [Folder](/2.%20Timeline)
- All the PDF files align to become a giant mural.
- This will require frequent updating. Would really appreciate it if you send in a pull request with any updates!

### Protest Artworks
- [Folder](/3.%20Artworks)
- Including a few with explanation like human chain, tear gas, etc
- They can be rearranged into any murals that work better for you.
- We stick them on butcher paper as a backing so it's easier to set up and reuse.

### Information
- [Folder](/4.%20Information%20and%20Signs%20for%20Venue)
- Some of these are for people to browse in areas without booths but with extra space. Like info on LiPig, Pepe, or Lennon Wall.
- There are a lot of random signage needed for a venue, like where bathrooms are!
- Warning signs for VR or uncomfortable triggers are included.

### Background Movie
- [Folder](/5.%20Background%20Videos)
- If you have a projector and some wall space this provides good ambience and a space for people to rest.
- Videos in the folder, youtube link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U-vwe3AB50)

### VR Area
- This require a set up where you can view 3D videos.
- We used headsets bought from Amazon and Google cardboard, and old phones.
- YouTube can play the 3D videos, we signed up for free 1st month of Youtube Premium and use that to download the video to ensure we are not blocked by WiFi speed, then turn on airplane mode to max battery life.
- [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN_hFG_P-5s)
- We used only 1 video, which is fantastic and people lined up for it
- Recommendations for future: have extra phones on hand because they do run out of charge (even on airplane mode). 
- THIS IS POPULAR!!

### Writing Table
- We put most of our [call to action](/Signs%20Around%20Venue/Call%20to%20Action) flyers here in the middle.
- We have printed out copies of the letters we would like to write to our senators, so people just need to sign and date.
- This is important for international communities! Pick the most impactful 1-2 people to write to per event.

### Lennon Wall
- This is created by volunteers on form boards and card stock paper so we can reuse for other art projects
- We created strings of cranes to decorate the space here and there as well
- Put up the [Photo Spot](/Signs%20Around%20Venue/Call%20to%20Action/en-US/Call%20to%20action-%20photo%20spot.pdf) signs with the trending hashtags to help visibility of the whole movement

### Food
- Solely because the volunteers also wanted fish balls.... yum.
- Please make sure you adhere to local food-serving guidelines to avoid being in trouble!
