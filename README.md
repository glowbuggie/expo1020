## Original Intention of the Expo

1. To bring awareness to the general public in USA of the civil unrest in Hong Kong that have already lasted for months. 
2. We want to educate the public from different perspectives to spark conversations and critical, independent thinking. Especially this movement is not only affecting Hong Kong, the HK govt and CCP are actually threatening the whole world 
3. To create and unite a community to keep engaging the situation in Hong Kong, and to provide supports to our Hong Kong 手足 when necessary 
4. The expo will be presented multiple times around Bay Area for similar purposes. It will be best if materials can be reused. And also will be updated for future expos as situations are changing dramatically 
5. The most important part is the booth hosts, to be able to deliver the message loud and clear. The materials are important but it is more powerful to directly have conversations with our visitors. To build relationship and be genuine.
